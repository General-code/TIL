# DOM
- **Document Object Model** which is rendered when the loading of html file is finished.
- âœ”**DOM and DOM methods are** not the part of the javascript(ecmascript). They are **just web API provided by web browser and can interact with javascript**
## Selecting Element
- When manipulating DOM Elements you can use querySelector("") and add class to the selected element writing code like this querySelector(".class").classList.add("invisible");
  - classList returns class list of an selected Element and there are it's methods such as **toggle, add, remove** 
  - You can gather all same elements using querySelectorAll then it will returns lists of the same elements. 
- **Every CSS property are camel case in javascript**, So you should remove hyphen and change that property into the camel case.
- when you **change CSS sytle uisng (some element Selected by selector).style.color = "value";** all the property value in javascript should be wrapped with "" so it would be the string

## Manipulating Text
- **innerHTML vs textContent** 
  - innerHTML returns the literally all the written things inside an selected element 
  - textContent returns only text of an selected element
  
- Manipulating attribute of an HTML element
  - you can get array of attributes of an element using .attributes;
  - you can see specific attribute using .getAttribute('attribute name');
  - change attribute .setAttribute('Attribute you are going to change', 'what you are going to change it to');
  
- When it comes to get the text in **input tag** we should **use value property**
  
## Control the Event
- addEventListener(type, function) throught this code you can add function to be called when listeners listen to the specific type behavior
- you can use debugger; in chrome developer tool
- We can **pass the event that trigers eventListener as a parameter to the function associated with the event listener**
- it's also possible for the entire web page to listen(wait for) to the event.(use document)
```javascript
      document.addEventListener('keydown',function(event){
        console.log(event);
      });
```


## Animation 
- To use Animation first add the effect and then use **setTimeout(function(){}, milisec)** to remove it then it will work like an animation
