## ISSUES
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Wihle I am coding at sparta I suddenly encountered some bootstrap related erros
  - I used combination of grid and card but some error occured. there should be 4 cards in a line when the view-port is desktop-size and should 2 cards with the same size in the small size. but the size of first card was different!!!😱😱
