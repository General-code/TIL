#### Javascript Array
- Array declaration
```javascript
const friends = ['kim', 'ho', 'pu']
const years = new Array(1991, 1984, 2008, 2020);
const jonas = ['jonas', 10];
```
- the rest of this is same with the other programming langues it
- yet this has length property and cna have any type of data

- **Push** method
  - Add element to the end of the array and returns the length of the array
- **unshift** method
  - Add element to the beginning of the array by passing argument in it.
- **pop** method
  - remove the last element so we don't need to pass any argument.
  - returns the removed data
- **shift** method
